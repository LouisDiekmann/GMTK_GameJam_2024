The townsfolk were no longer interested in fighting monsters or travelling to other lands. 

And so it was that Pothos the Green was no longer wanted for his magical wizardry in battle, but rather for changing the size of their everyday objects.

And such was the fate of Pothos the Green. Forever using his immense power to help the crooked old townsfolk of Sorrow's Creek with their belongings."
